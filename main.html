            <div class="article-text">
                Despite widespread recognition that a <a href="#">crypto winter</a> is having a chilling effect on everything from Bitcoin (down roughly 60% for the year) to <a href="#">GPUs</a>
                (graphics chips used for crypto mining saw a 15% price drop in May), last week’s NFT.NYC conference turned Times Square into a hotbed of crypto enthusiasm as 15,000 artists, fans, creators, and collectors gathered to celebrate the long-term prospects of NFT tech despite the sector’s 
                <a href="#">nearly 40% drop</a> in market cap since April. While big-name NFT collections like Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and celebrity crypto boosters like Snoop Dogg produced some of the buzziest headlines of the week, plenty of promising NFT news emerged from different corners of the market as well. Let’s take a closer look.
            </div>
            <ul class="article-one__list">
                <li class="article-one__list--item">
                    <div class="article-one__list--item bold">Amid crypto’s downturn, NFT.NYC signaled enthusiasm about the current “build market,” </div>as one panel host <a href="#">put it</a>. From a company called <a href="#">Danvas</a> that is building “museum-quality” displays for digital art, to panels about how artists can use NFT 
                    <a href="#">smart contracts</a> to automatically receive royalty payments each time their work is resold, to major brands like Samsung and Nickelodeon 
                    <a href="#">exploring</a> metaverse marketing — the conference teemed with optimism for what the CEO of the 
                    <a href="#">Doodles</a> NFT project called the “incredibly bright” future of the industry.

                    <div class="article-one__list--item bold">Of course, the digital art clubs behind blue-chip NFTs like BAYC and upstarts like Goblintown continued to lead the hype train. </div>
                    BAYC threw its second annual ApeFest party, a Hudson River-adjacent bash featuring a giant inflatable ape and performances from The Roots and LCD Soundsystem; World of Women co-hosted a party with <a href="#">Madonna</a>; and <a href="#">Goblintown</a> — which skyrocketed into the zeitgeist this month — had a meme-worthy event with <a href="#">gibberish-speaking</a> actors dressed as goblins. (Goblintown saw trading volumes more than <a href="#">triple</a> in a single day last week.)

                    <div class="article-one__list--item bold">Among the event’s most notable attendees were Snoop Dogg, Pharrell, and Spike Lee. </div>
                    Snoop, an avid NFT collector and <a href="#">entrepreneur</a> with a new <a href="#">Bored Ape music video</a>, told <a href="#">CNBC</a> that the market downturn “weeded out … all the people that were abusing the opportunities” (like the event’s <a href="#">Snoop Dogg impersonator</a>?) and that the market will emerge stronger. Pharrell <a href="#">unveiled</a> his new role as the chief brand officer for the popular Doodles collection, and Do The Right Thing director Spike Lee <a href="#">said</a> using NFTs to fund films is “bringing more democracy to filmmaking.”

                    A year after eBay first <a href="#">enabled NFT sales</a>, the e-commerce giant purchased KnownOrigin, which currently <a href="#">ranks twelfth</a> for all-time, ETH-based NFT trading volume at $7.8 million. Meanwhile, the company behind <a href="#">Uniswap</a> (a leading <a href="#">decentralized exchange</a> with over $1 trillion in trading volume) <a href="#">acquired</a> NFT marketplace aggregator Genie, which lets users trade NFTs across most marketplaces.

                    NFT marketplace Magic Eden was valued this month at <a href="#">$1.6 billion</a> following a Series B round that raised $130 million. And 1confirmation, a venture firm backed by Peter Thiel, Marc Andreessen, and Mark Cuban recently <a href="#">announced</a> the creation of a new $100 million NFT-focused fund. Explaining the firm’s move, 1confirmation founder Nick Tomaino <a href="#">addressed</a> some of the criticism lobbed at NFTs: “NFTs look like a speculative casino on the surface, but the truth is they offer a better business model for creators and empower consumers to become owners.”

                <div class="article-text bold">Why it matters... </div>
                While NFT.NYC provided the splashiest headlines in the non-fungible 
                hemisphere of the crypto world last week, all kinds of encouraging 
                developments continue to defy the <a href="#">FUD</a>-iest crypto winter narratives. 
                Compared to this time last year, trading volume for top NFT 
                marketplace OpenSea has more than <a href="#">doubled</a>; the amount of people 
                holding NFTs is at an <a href="#">all-time high</a>; and major financial firms like 
                <a href="#">Goldman Sachs</a> and <a href="#">Mastercard</a> are exploring NFT integrations. And 
                even though much of the NFT art showcased at NFT.NYC has lost 
                significant dollar value this year, optimism about the future of the 
                tech permeated the event. As the conference’s co-founder Jodee Rich 
                <a href="#">put it</a>, “NFTs are going to disrupt most industries—identity, 
                ticketing, brands, music, fashion, real estate … We are still at a 
                very early stage. This is the beginning of a long-term trend.”

            <img class="article-image" src="assets/DJ_3LAU.jpeg" alt="Image of 3LAU">
            <div class="article-text">
                Last week at NFT.NYC, Coinbase caught up with DJ, electronic music producer, and long-time crypto enthusiast Justin Blau — better known by his stage name 3LAU — to discuss the latest happenings in the world of NFTs. In addition to being an accomplished musician, Blau is also the co-founder of Royal, an NFT music rights startup that counts Andreessen Horowitz among its investors. Here’s what he had to say.<br><br>
                <div class="article-text bold">Coinbase: How did you get into the crypto space?<br><br></div>
                <div class="article-text bold">3LAU:</div>
                I actually met Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss [founders of crypto exchange Gemini] in Mexico on spring break, and they told me a little bit about Bitcoin. I was excited by the idea of banking the unbanked in developing countries and frictionless value transfer across the world. And I bought some of my first Bitcoin in 2014.<br><br>
                <div class="article-text bold">What role would you say community plays within the NFT space?<br><br></div>
                <div class="article-text bold">3LAU:</div>
                 I think the whole beauty of any NFT-specific project is building a connection between an artist and a fan. And it's not even just an artist and a fan. It's also fan to fan where you've got all of these different people that have mutual appreciation for a piece of art, or for a community. So community is kind of essential to any project’s success.<br><br>
                <div class="article-text bold">You’ve spoken about collective ownership and how that helps support the artist. Do you think that's something unique to the NFT space?<br><br></div>
                <div class="article-text bold">3LAU:</div>
                 When you go online and you look at your favorite artist's work on Instagram, or you listen to your favorite musician's song on Spotify, the relationship you have with that artist is purely consumption in that you're just looking at the image and you're just listening to the song. The beauty of NFTs is it creates this digital authenticity surrounding the idea of digital ownership.
And now you can show that support for the artist and prove it on-chain. So if you find a new artist that isn't that big yet, and you buy one of their pieces of art, or you engage with that community — you have proof on the blockchain that you were there from the beginning. And that is such an incredibly powerful concept. People love being first to creators that are really powerful, and this technology enables and unlocks an entirely new value chain around that.<br><br>
                <div class="article-text bold">For somebody who's very new to the space, how should they get started?<br><br></div>
                <div class="article-text bold">3LAU:</div>
                 If I was advising someone in buying their first NFT, I would honestly say, find something you like at a reasonable price, buy it, and see how it makes you feel. Because until you do that, until you take that first step, it's almost impossible to know. Maybe that artist doesn't resonate with you. Maybe they do and you want to collect more from that artist. And so it's really all about how it makes you feel. If you have a painting in your house or a framed photo in your house, it's a part of your identity. I think that NFTs should represent who you are in a digital identity format.<br><br>
